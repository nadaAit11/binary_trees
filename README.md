## Description üìù
This repository contains C programs that implement various binary tree operations.

## Requirements üì¶
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
* All source files should end with a new line.
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
* The code should follow the Betty style and will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
* Global variables are not allowed.
* No more than 5 functions per file.
* The standard C library is allowed.
* The prototypes of all functions should be included in a header file named `binary_trees.h`.
* Don't forget to push your header file.
* All header files should have include guards.
* There should be one project repository per group. Cloning, forking, or using a repository with the same name before the second deadline may result in a 0% score.
